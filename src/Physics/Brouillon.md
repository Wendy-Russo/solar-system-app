###### Formula

Force = G * (M1 * M2) / r²

###### Where

G = gravitational constant 

M = masses of the 2 objects

r² = distance squared

---

###### **Equation of linear Motion**

d(t) = d0 + v0 * t + 1/2 * a * t²

###### Where

d(t) = displacement of the planet at time t

d₀ = initial displacement

v₀ = initial velocity

a = acceleration

t = time

---

###### **Acceleration**

a = F / m

a = ( G * (M1 * M2) / r² ) / m

a = G *  M2 / r²

###### Where

a = acceleration

G = gravitational constant

M = masses of the other object

r² = distance squared
